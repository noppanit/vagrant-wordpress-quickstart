Wordpress quickstart
============================

A project that helps you get started on wordpress easily. Although <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/vip-quickstart">VIP</a> has provided a simple and easy
quickstart project already. I think there should be someting simple so I decided to use Ansible instead of Puppet.


# What you need
1. Vagrant

# How to get started?
1. `vagrant up`
2. go to `http://localhost:8888`
3. Install your wordpress as normal.

# Configuration.
